    "**NumPy**, short for Numerical Python, is considered a foundational Python package for numerical computations [1]. The NumPy package was established by Travis Oliphant in 2005. It was meant as a successor to two earlier scientific Python libraries, Numeric and Numarray, with the goal of bringing a fragmented scientific computing community together around a single framework [2][3].\n",

    "NumPy is an open-source external Python module that provides common mathematical and numerical routines in pre-compiled, fast functions for manipulating large arrays and matrices of numeric data [4]. Numpy does not come pre installed with the Python standard library but can be installed using package manager programs such as pip. Alternatively NumPy does come pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution and it is recommended as the simplest way to get started for scientific computing and data science [5].\n",

The NumPy package is imported as np to save time when writing multiple commands now you only need call np.x instead of numpy.x. np is a convention used to ensure other users reading the code understand it [4][6]. \n",
