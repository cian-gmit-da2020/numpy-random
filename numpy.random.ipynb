    "`NumPy`, short for Numerical Python, is considered a foundational Python package for numerical computations [1]. The NumPy package was established by Travis Oliphant in 2005. It was meant as a successor to two earlier scientific Python libraries, Numeric and Numarray, with the goal of bringing a fragmented scientific computing community together around a single framework [2][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is an open-source external Python module that provides common mathematical and numerical routines in pre-compiled, fast functions for manipulating large arrays and matrices of numeric data [4]. Numpy does not come pre-installed with the Python standard library but can be installed using package manager programs such as `pip`. Alternatively, NumPy does come pre-installed with the `Anaconda distribution` and it is recommended as the simplest way to get started for scientific computing and data science [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is an external package NumPy must be imported with an import statement in order for all of its functions to be accesible to you. This can be done like the code shown below. The NumPy package is imported **as np** to save time when writing multiple commands, now you only need call np.x instead of numpy.x. The **numpy as np** convention is used to ensure other users reading the code understand it [4][6]. \n",

    "#### 2a) Pseudo random number generation\n",
    "***\n",
    "It is extremely difficult for computers and computer programs to generate truly random numbers. Instead what programs do, including NumPy's random module, is they create what are called `pseudo random numbers`. These programs use algorithms with defined deterministic behaviour to generate a value or range of values that seem random to an observer [8][9].\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's recommended Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG), `Generator`, uses O’Neill’s permutation congruential generator algorithm, `(PCG64)`, as the default method for generating random numbers [10]. Legacy versions of numpy.random as well as python's `stdlib random module` use the Mersenne Twister algorithm, `(MT19937)`[11]. Historically NumPy had a strict backwards compatibility policy for it's random number generation functions. This restricted upgrades and improvements to it's processes as any changes had to comply to this policy. More recent releases are not strictly compatible with previous versions allowing changes such as the move to the PCG64 algorithm [12]. The PCG family of algorithms are considered faster, more efficient and less predictable than most other generators including the Mersenne Twister [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, it is still possible to access the Mersenne Twister algorithm to generate random numbers but in the latest version of numpy the default algorithm is PCG64. When default_rng and PCG64() are used with the same seed value they produce identical outputs.\n"

While these are not true random values they are statistically similar to random [4]. This behaviour can be very useful, especially in fields where reproducibility is key. PRNG's in the numpy.random package allow you to set this initial state in a parameter called `seed`[14]. \n",

    "If no value is passed as the seed parameter of default_rng() then data will be pulled from the operating system and will generate unpredictable values [10]. In the past it had been popular to set the global state of a program using `numpy.random.seed()`. While this function is still available it is recommended that this is not used as setting a global state can cause other problems [12]. Instead each generator object should be initialised with a seed as a parameter. If the generator needs to be reseeded it is now best practice to recreate the a new generator as opposed to reseeding using numpy.random.seed() as shown below .\n",

In this a seed should be passed to each generator when it is initialised to set it's initial state. If that state needs to be reset later then a new generator should be formed with a new seed. If it is required that the results are not easy to reproduce or predict then the seed value should be selected in a nondeterministic fashion and hidden[14].   \n",

    "Numpy's random module provides many methods and functions for efficiently generating large samples of random data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as the python stdlib random module can only sample one value at a time, numpy.random allows for much more efficient generation of ranges and multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to quickly generate large arrays of data, from simple ints and floats to many different advance statistical probability distributions. These can be used for calculations, models and visualisations of key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy.random module is constantly evolving and more recent versions have changed to recommend the Generator object. This has reduced backward compatibility of code and requires the user to be more aware of package versions and use virtual enviroments for specific tasks or legacy code. The changes however should allow for increase functionality and performance as numpy.random adopts faster and improved algorithms such as the O’Neill’s permutation congruential generator algorithm (PCG64)."
