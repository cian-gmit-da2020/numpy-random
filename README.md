# Problem Statement

The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python . You are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

# Required software/dependencies
To run the code in the notebook some software packages are required. The code was written and tested in the versions lsited below but may work in older version of the software. All packages are available in the latest version of the anaconda distribution of python.

1. Python v3.8.3
2. Numpy v1.18.5
3. Seaborn v0.10.1

# Using the Jupyter Notebook
***
To run the notebook on your machine you will need to have Juptyer installed. If you have the anaconda distribution you should already have Jupyter installed. If not running anaconda and you have pip installed you can download Jupyter using the `pip install` command in the command line like below.
```
pip install jupyter
```
Now that you have Jupyter installed, you can download the notebook. To launch the notebook app navigate to the directory the file is stored in on the command line and enter the `jupyter notebook` command as below:
```
>>> jupyter notebook
```
The jupyter notebook app should launch in your browser and should contain the contents of the directory you were in. Simply select the numpy.random.ipynb notebook file to open in the browser. [1]

All code cells contain examples of code detailed in Markdown cells. All code cells should work independant of each other. Code can be run using the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`
